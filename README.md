## Azure Function

### `alert-endpoint`

Accepts alert data from Azure Monitors using the Common Alert Schema - formats alert data
as an [AdaptiveCard](https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/) and then sends it to an
[MS Teams Incoming Webhook](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook)

- Type: HTTP Trigger
- Auth: Anonymous
- Accepts:
  - Method: `POST`
  - Content-Type: `application/json`
  - Schema: `azureMonitorCommonAlertSchema`
    - [Definitions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-common-schema-definitions)

    - Details:
      - Gives most important info at a glance
      - Color bar changes based on incident type/stage
      - Buttons to toggle additional details or go to service issues page in Azure Portal
      - HTML in communication converted to Markdown so it displays properly

      - Color bar changes based on alert type and number of peers affected
      - Button to go view the alert in the Azure Portal
    - Additional Notes/Requirements
      - Manages state using a JSON file (kept in Blob Storage inside the Function App's existing storage account)
      - You can specify the blob container (useful for dev vs prod) by setting an environment variable: `BLOB_CONTAINER_NAME`
        - Uses default value of `functions-data` if `BLOB_CONTAINER_NAME` is not provided
    - Examples
      - Primary Down
        ![express-route-alert-one.png](./assets/readme-images/express-route-alert-one.png)

  - ExpressRoute Bursts via log query search
    - [Schema](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-common-schema-definitions#monitoringservice--log-alerts-v2)
    - Currently supports ExpressRoute BitsInPerSecond/BitsOutPerSecond Log Searches
      - Example query: `AzureMetrics | where MetricName == 'BitsOutPerSecond' and Maximum >= 50000000 | order by TimeGenerated desc | limit 10 | where TimeGenerated > ago(10m) | summarize BitsOutPerSecond = sum(Maximum) by TimeGenerated`
      - Details:

## Local Development

### Requirements

- Node.js = v16.x
- npm >= v6.x

### Getting Started

1. Clone repo `git clone https://github.com/CU-CommunityApps/ct-az-common-alert-endpoint.git your-folder-name`
1. Enter directory `cd your-folder-name`
1. Install dependencies `npm install`
1. Set up environment variables in `.env` and `local.settings.json`:
   - **REQUIRED**
     - `MS_TEAMS_NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK_URL`
       - URL of MS Teams Incoming Webhook to be used for informational notifications
     - `MS_TEAMS_ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL`
       - URL of MS Teams Incoming Webhook to be used for actionable alerts (can be same as `MS_TEAMS_NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK_URL`)
   - **OPTIONAL**
     - `MS_TEAMS_DEV_WEBHOOK_URL`
       - URL of MS Teams Incoming Webhook to be used for unsupported payloads and development - if not provided, function will fall back to `MS_TEAMS_NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK_URL`
     - `BLOB_CONTAINER_NAME`
       - Name of the Azure Blob container to use for storing state files - defaults to `functions-data`
     - `LOCAL_DEV`
       - Set to `true` to override alert and notification webhooks during development
       - Make sure to also set up `MS_TEAMS_DEV_WEBHOOK_URL` with a value or it will fall back to `MS_TEAMS_NOTIFICATION_WEBHOOK_URL`
     - `WEBSITE_RUN_FROM_PACKAGE`
       - Change to `0` to _trick_ the runtime into reloading when changes are made (otherwise you have to manually stop and run again)

1. Run locally `npm run functions` (for verbose logging use `npm run functions:verbose`)

#### Posting Sample Data Using `curl`

Assumes functions are running locally using instructions above and you are in the root of the repo directory in your terminal

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data "@assets/sample-data/service-health-alert.json" http://localhost:7071/api/alert-endpoint
```
